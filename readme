Predicting the accurate stock price has been the aim of investors ever since the beginning of the stock market. Millions of dollars worth of trading happens every single day, and every trader hopes to earn profit from his/her investments. Investors who can make right buy and sell decisions will end up in profits. To make right decisions, investors have to judge based on technical analysis, such as companyâ€™s charts, stock market indices and information from newspapers and microblogs. However, it is difficult for investors to analyze and forecast the market by churning all this information. Therefore, to predict the trends automatically, many Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been investigated. This is an attempt to predict the market price by using deep learning models such as neural networks, tensorflow and RELU. The dataset was taken from kaggle.
